# The same trap, one layer down. `Settings` reads the deployment's `.env`, so
# the suite inherits whatever the developer's machine happens to be running.
#
# That is untidy until a `.env` is valid for a service and not for a test, at
# which point it breaks collection. A deployment that keeps its secrets in a
# manager and hydrates them at boot writes `HONCHO_ENABLED=true` with no
# `HONCHO_API_KEY` beside it — correct for that service, and fatal for a
# `Settings()` built in a test: "HONCHO_ENABLED=true requires HONCHO_API_KEY",
# raised at COLLECTION time, so 32 tests across 7 modules died before one of
# them ran. Nothing in the suite touched any of them.
#
# Cutting the file out is the fix, not clearing whichever flags happen to hurt
# today: os.environ is something this file controls and a test can monkeypatch,
# `.env` is neither, and a test that does `monkeypatch.delenv("HONCHO_ENABLED")`
# to assert the default would have the deployment's value quietly reappear
# underneath it. Everything Settings genuinely requires is set above.
