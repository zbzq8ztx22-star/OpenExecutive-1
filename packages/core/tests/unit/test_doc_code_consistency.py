"""Doc/code consistency guards.

These tests fail when the curated architecture facts drift from what the code
actually does — the failure mode the ``/architecture`` page is most prone to
(see ``CLAUDE.md`` -> "Architecture Docs"). They are deliberately coupled to
BOTH the YAML and the code, so changing one without the other breaks CI.

Current coverage: the ``wait_for_human`` resume invariant (the canonical drift
example — the docs and the code have now disagreed in BOTH directions, first
claiming paused workflows auto-continued when they did not, and later still
calling resume deferred after it shipped). Add further invariants here as they
are identified.
