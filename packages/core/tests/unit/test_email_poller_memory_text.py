"""Peer memory records only the sender's own words for an inbound email.

The Executive's turn carries the whole message — the "You have an inbound
email" framing, every header (the Executive's own address in To:), the
quoted chain (often the Executive's own earlier email) and the attachment
listing. Recorded under the sender's peer, Honcho concluded the sender *was*
the Executive: "<sender> is associated with <exec address>", "<sender>
received an email from <sender>", "<sender> had requested the report from
<sender>". ``_email_memory_text`` keeps the subject, the new text and the
attachment filenames, and ``_run_executive`` passes it as ``memory_text``.
