"""Generic HTTP-backed LLMProvider for any OpenAI-compatible chat API.

This is the shared engine behind both ``OpenRouterProvider`` and local /
self-hosted backends (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp). It speaks the
OpenAI ``/chat/completions`` wire format; the translator package converts
request/response/stream shapes so call sites stay Anthropic-native.

What's intentionally configurable so a single class serves every
OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

* ``base_url`` — ``https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`` for OpenRouter,
  ``http://localhost:11434/v1`` for Ollama, etc.
* ``api_key`` — optional. Many local servers need no auth, so when it's
  ``None`` we omit the ``Authorization`` header entirely rather than send
  ``Bearer None``.
* ``default_headers`` — provider-specific attribution headers (OpenRouter
  sets ``HTTP-Referer`` / ``X-Title``); local backends pass nothing.

Streaming notes:

* SSE chunks arrive as JSON objects in ``data: ...`` lines.
* The Executive's loop iterates ``async for event in stream`` looking for
  ``content_block_delta`` with ``delta.type == "text_delta"`` (the streaming
  text path) and then awaits ``stream.get_final_message()`` to read the
  fully assembled message (with tool_use blocks). We yield text deltas
  inline and accumulate tool_call fragments into the final message.
