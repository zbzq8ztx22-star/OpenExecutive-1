"""Act as me: what a turn may still do once it has read the owner's own mail.

``ghostwrite_email`` reads mail other people wrote to the owner. From the
round it runs in until the turn ends, nothing that reaches anyone else runs:
no message, post, broadcast or invite, no queued or started work, no fetch of
an outside address, and no write to state other people read (the roster,
goals, skills, the watchlist, alerts, memory). Text from that mail could
otherwise steer the model into carrying it somewhere, or into acting on it.

Every tool the Executive can be offered is classified here, in exactly one of
``MAIL_TOUCHED_ALLOWED_TOOLS`` or ``MAIL_TOUCHED_WITHHELD_TOOLS`` (a test fails
until a new tool is), and anything unclassified is withheld. Through MCP
``call_tool`` only the Google Workspace reads stay (``MAIL_TOUCHED_MCP_READS``).

The dispatch guard in ``orchestrator.executive`` refuses a withheld call
without changing the offered tool list (the cached prefix stays the same all
turn), and treats a round that calls ``ghostwrite_email`` as already touched,
because a round's tools run concurrently. The send paths check again
(``mail_touched_refusal``) so nothing that reaches them in such a turn runs.
The server-side ``web_search`` stays, as on a turn private to the owner: it
cannot be refused at dispatch without a cache miss. The lockdown lasts for
the turn; the owner's next message starts afresh, except in a conversation
that has read their mail (``sessions.mail_private``), where every turn
starts touched (``settings.pin_turn_delegation``).
