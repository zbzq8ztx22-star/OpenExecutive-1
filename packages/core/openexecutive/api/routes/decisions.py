"""Decisions API — the approve/reject/edit surface for gated Executive proposals.

This is the approve→execute bridge: proposals written by calendar_tools (and
future classes) sit in the trust ledger as `status='proposed'` until a human
acts here. What approving, rejecting and cancelling DO is per class: each class
resolved here has a ``DecisionClassSpec`` in ``DECISION_CLASSES`` (meeting
booking: create the calendar event on approve, delete it on cancel). An
instance of any other class is refused with 409, never carried out as some
other class.

Routes:
  GET  /decisions            — list instances (filter by class, status)
  GET  /decisions/{id}       — single instance detail
  POST /decisions/{id}/approve — approve (optionally with edited payload)
  POST /decisions/{id}/reject  — reject
  GET  /decisions/classes/meeting_scheduling — the class's autonomy mode
  PUT  /decisions/classes/meeting_scheduling — set it (principal only)
  GET  /audit/reliability    — per-class reliability card (also in audit.py router)
