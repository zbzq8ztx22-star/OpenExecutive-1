"""Anthropic tool definitions + handlers for proactive scheduling and direct channel sends.

These tools are exposed to the Executive alongside `consult_specialist` and the
skill tools. They let the Executive:

- queue a future proactive message via `schedule_followup`
- queue a workflow suggestion (deep-linked nudge) via `suggest_workflow`
- send a Telegram message directly via `send_telegram_message`
- send a Slack DM directly via `send_slack_dm`
- send a Discord DM directly via `send_discord_dm`
- look up a person by name via `lookup_person` (returns routing identifiers)

Email sends already work via the MCP gateway's mail send tool (Gmail's
`google_workspace__send_gmail_message` or Outlook's `microsoft_365__send-mail`,
per EMAIL_PROVIDER — see `integrations.workspace`), so there is no `send_email`
wrapper here.

    Bind this around the *whole* stream, from outside the Executive's async
    generator — not with a bare ``current_session.set()`` inside it.

    `Executive.stream_chat` does call `current_session.set(session)` at its
    top, and that is enough for the callers that drive it with a plain
    ``async for`` (the adapters' `.chat()` wrapper, the CLI, tests). It is NOT
    enough for the SSE chat route, which drives the generator one step at a
    time under ``asyncio.wait_for(stream.__anext__(), ...)``. `wait_for` wraps
    each step in a fresh Task that *copies* the context, so a `set()` made
    inside the generator mutates a throwaway copy and is gone by the next
    resume: step one sees the session, every step after it sees ``None``.
    The tool-call loop runs on those later steps, so every handler reading
    `current_session` got ``None`` on web — silently.

    That cost a production incident. `ack_alert` reads the turn's trusted
    alert board off the session; with ``None`` it fell back to an empty set
    and refused every ack the principal asked for, on the one surface they
    actually use. The same ``None`` also blanks the `session_id` on
    `scheduled_actions` rows and disables `schedule_followup`'s
    seen-channel_refs anti-spam gate, which only fires when it can see a
    session.

    Save/restore rather than ``Token.reset()``, for the same reason
    `audit.context.set_turn` does it: the Token variant raises ``ValueError:
    <Token …> was created in a different Context`` when ``__exit__`` runs in a
    different Context than ``__enter__`` — exactly what task-hopping SSE
    drivers produce. Save/restore is Context-independent.

      company-wide and is kept out of shared channels, Google Chat and other

      every ack — every `Session` starts with one, so "widen if a set exists"
      would have let any of them find-then-ack anything.
    - Only ids this function's SQL returned, never anything from the model's
      arguments. `query` steers WHICH rows come back; it cannot name an id.
    - Only open rows (`_FIND_ALERTS_ACKABLE_STATUSES`), never roster-request
      cards (answered by `resolve_roster_request`, not acked).
    - At most `_FIND_ALERTS_MAX_LIMIT` rows per call and
