# Pinned to a commit, not the default branch. Unpinned, uvx resolved `main` on
# GitHub at every container start, so a published image ran whatever the
# gateway repo held that day: a push there changed every deployment on its next
# restart, rolling back an image tag did not roll the gateway back, and a start
# with no network failed outright because only GitHub can say what `main` is.
# The repo has no release tags, so a commit is the only stable ref.
#
# The commit alone fixes extensible-mcp's own code, not its dependencies: uvx
# re-resolves its ~94 transitive packages against PyPI's version ranges on
# every networked start, so a new release of any of them would still reach
# running deployments on restart. `--exclude-newer` freezes that resolution to
# packages published before the cutoff, which also makes the Dockerfile's
# pre-warm cache exactly what the runtime resolves — so a start needs no
# network when that best-effort pre-warm succeeded. Bump the commit and the
# cutoff together, deliberately; tests/unit/
# test_extensible_mcp_pin.py fails if docker/Dockerfile's pre-warm drifts from
# _EXTENSIBLE_MCP_LAUNCH_ARGS.
