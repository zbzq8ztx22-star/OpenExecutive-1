# Pinned to a commit, not the default branch. Unpinned, uvx resolved `main` on
# GitHub at every container start, so a published image ran whatever the
# gateway repo held that day: a push there changed every deployment on its next
# restart, rolling back an image tag did not roll the gateway back, and a start
# with no network failed outright because only GitHub can say what `main` is.
# The repo has no release tags, so a commit is the only stable ref.
#
# The commit alone fixes extensible-mcp's own code, not its dependencies: uvx
# re-resolves its ~94 transitive packages against PyPI's version ranges on
# every networked start, so a new release of any of them would still reach
# running deployments on restart. `--exclude-newer` freezes that resolution to
# packages published before the cutoff, which also makes the Dockerfile's
# pre-warm cache exactly what the runtime resolves — so a start needs no
# network when that best-effort pre-warm succeeded. Bump the commit and the
# cutoff together, deliberately; tests/unit/
# test_extensible_mcp_pin.py fails if docker/Dockerfile's pre-warm drifts from
# _EXTENSIBLE_MCP_LAUNCH_ARGS.

    """Names the MCP config at `config_path` defines under `mcpServers`.

    Empty when the file is absent, unreadable, oversized, not a JSON object, or
    defines no servers. Callers use this to decide whether starting the gateway
    can accomplish anything: extensible-mcp's own config loader ends with
    `ValueError("Config must define at least one server in 'mcpServers'")` and
    exits, and because the child is already gone by then the only thing that
    reaches us is anyio's "Attempted to exit cancel scope in a different task"
    from `stdio_client` unwinding — a traceback that names nothing about
    configuration (#122). Checking first is what makes the failure legible.

    That an empty `mcpServers` is fatal to the child rather than merely idle is
    confirmed in #122 by the maintainer reading extensible-mcp's own
    `load_config`, so skipping the gateway here removes no working
    configuration: a "servers are added at runtime via load_mcp_server" config
    never brought the gateway up either. It only makes the failure legible.

    NEVER RAISES, and the breadth of the `except` is deliberate: this reads an
    operator-owned path during startup, where an exception is the crash loop
    #122 was filed for rather than a bug report. Nothing here is subtle enough
    to be worth a narrower catch — `json.loads` answers deeply-nested input
    with `RecursionError`, which is not a `ValueError`, and a read can fail in
    as many ways as the filesystem has moods. `mcp_config_file_present` keeps a
    directory or a symlink to a FIFO from ever being opened.

    Every key under `mcpServers` counts as a server, `_comment` included. That
    is deliberate: a stray key there is a misconfiguration worth surfacing as a
    server name in the log, not one worth hiding.
