"""What happens around a roster request (``people.roster_requests``).

An inbound adapter that meets a sender who is not on the roster — and is not
one of the principal's contacts — calls ``intake``. That:

1. holds the message on the sender's pending request (opening one if needed);
2. on a new request, puts a private card on the principal's /today and tells
   the principal on their preferred channel (a chat DM they can answer in
   place, or an email carrying a one-time token they can reply to);
3. acknowledges the sender with a fixed text — never the model, never an
   echo of what they wrote — at most once per sender per
   ``ROSTER_ACK_WINDOW_DAYS`` and ``ROSTER_ACK_DAILY_CAP`` a day overall. The
   adapter delivers it where only the sender sees it (a DM, an ephemeral
   Slack message, a private Telegram chat, an email to that one address).

When the principal answers (``answer``: the web card, their chat tool, their
email reply — ``try_email_roster_answer``), the held messages are replayed
through the adapter that received them (``register_replayer``), now that
the sender is on the roster, so the Executive answers them as if they had
been all along. Replays run in a fresh ``contextvars.Context``: the answer
may have come from the principal's own verified turn, and a stranger's
message must never be read with the principal's session (and contacts)
still bound.
