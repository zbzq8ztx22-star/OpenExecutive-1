"""MCP-based inbound mailbox polling loop.

Polls the Executive's own mailbox through the configured workspace backend
(`integrations.workspace`: Gmail via workspace-mcp, or Outlook via
ms-365-mcp-server — `EMAIL_PROVIDER`). Each unread message is rendered into
one backend-neutral text (`workspace.mail.render_for_executive`) and handed
to the Executive, which decides what to do: reply, fetch attachments, create
an alert, or ignore. The `--- REPLY ---` block at the end of that text names
the exact reply tool and threading ids for the backend in use, so the persona
stays backend-neutral (and cacheable).

No reply logic, no attachment logic, no alert logic lives here — all of that is the
Executive's responsibility via its tool access. The backend argument shapes
live in `workspace/google.py` and `workspace/microsoft.py`.
