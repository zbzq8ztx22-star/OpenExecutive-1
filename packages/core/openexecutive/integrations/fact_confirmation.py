"""Email confirmation for standing facts and company-profile edits.

The principal can ask for a correction by email ("Maple House is 48 units,
not 52"), and the fact tools check it exactly as they would in chat
(``orchestrator.fact_tools``). But a From line proves nothing: anyone can
send mail that claims to be the principal, and a standing fact is read by
every later prompt as their own account. So an emailed change is held, never
applied, until the principal's own mailbox confirms it:

1. ``request_confirmation`` stores the change with the hash of a fresh
   one-time token (``memory.facts.hold_confirmation``) and emails the token
   to the principal's primary address — the address on the roster, not the
   From line. The token never reaches a model: the tool result leaves it out,
   and the MCP gateway hides it from every read of the Executive's mailbox
   (``mcp_gateway.hide_roster_tokens``), where the sent email sits.
2. The principal replies CONFIRM (or CANCEL). The email poller hands every
   inbound message to ``try_email_fact_confirmation`` before any model turn,
   as it does for roster-request answers. A reply counts only from the
   principal's primary address, carrying a pending token, and passing DMARC
   as Gmail recorded it (``authenticated_by_gmail``); the change is then
   applied (``fact_tools.apply_confirmed``) and the principal is told what
   happened.

The request itself must pass the same check (``Session.email_authenticated``),
so mail that only claims the principal's address cannot fill their inbox with
confirmation requests.

A token works once (a compare-and-set, so two replies cannot apply it twice)
and expires after ``memory.facts.CONFIRM_TTL``. At most
``MAX_PENDING_CONFIRMATIONS`` changes wait at once, so a stream of mail cannot
bury the principal's inbox in confirmation requests.
