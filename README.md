Open Executive is designed to transform leadership and management. Highly configurable, it can be deployed at any management level. Out of the box it supports spend approval thresholds, integration with corporate knowledge systems, and defined governance for how it interacts with human colleagues and other AI systems. Open Executive can also act as a busy leader's digital twin: with **Act as me** switched on, it drafts email in their own voice, from their own Gmail, for them to review and send—so leaders can truly scale their impact through AI without giving up the final say.

It meets people where they already work, with integrations for Slack, Discord, Telegram, email, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365 (Outlook mail and calendar), Notion and any MCP-compatible AI tool, with more on the roadmap. Open Executive will always be open source.

A managed cloud offering is coming (https://openexecutive.ai), where you can get access without deploying anything yourself.


## Demo

[![Open Executive demo video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/O_g97xxVTMk/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/O_g97xxVTMk)

A walkthrough of Open Executive in action — [watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/O_g97xxVTMk).

## What It Does

Developed by [sentelabs.ai](https://sentelabs.ai) Open Executive provides a single coherent executive voice backed by nine specialist AI agents:

- **Chief Strategy Officer** — competitive analysis, M&A, market positioning, OKRs
- **Chief Financial Officer** — financial modeling, fundraising, unit economics, cash flow
- **Chief HR/People Officer** — hiring, compensation, performance, culture
- **General Counsel** — contracts, IP, employment law basics, compliance
- **Chief Operating Officer** — process design, vendor management, operational scaling
- **Chief Marketing Officer** — GTM strategy, brand, communications, PR
- **Chief Product Officer** — roadmap, prioritization, product strategy
- **Head of Sales** — pipeline and qualification, founder-led sales, pricing conversations, proposals, forecasting
- **Board Communications Director** — board decks, investor relations, governance

All responses come from one consistent executive voice. The internal agent architecture is never exposed to the user. Beyond Q&A, the system maintains episodic memory of past decisions and initiatives across sessions, and a built-in scheduler can proactively surface follow-ups and time-sensitive actions.

## Architecture

```
User message
    ↓
Executive Orchestrator (claude-sonnet-5)
    ↓ tool use → parallel specialist calls
CSO / CFO / CHRO / GC / COO / CMO / CPO / Board
    ↓ each specialist retrieves relevant context from ChromaDB
Built-in MBA knowledge + Your company documents
    ↓
Synthesized executive response
```

**Knowledge** — Two retrieval layers per specialist call: (1) built-in MBA-level Markdown (`knowledge/builtin/`, git-tracked) seeded into ChromaDB at startup, and (2) your uploaded company documents chunked and stored in a separate `company_docs` collection. RAG context is injected into the user turn, never the cached system prompt.

**Episodic memory** — After every response, a background `claude-haiku-4-5` pass extracts key decisions, initiatives, and advice into SQLite. The next session opens with a `<past_decisions>` block so the Executive remembers what it recommended last month.

**Scheduler** — A built-in job runner claims due actions via `UPDATE … RETURNING` to prevent double-firing. The API must run as a single instance; do not horizontally scale it without gating the scheduler first.

**Prompt caching** — The system prompt is structured so the Executive persona, company profile, and knowledge index are cached separately (up to 85% cache hit rate after the first few turns). No dynamic content ever goes in a cached block.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the full design.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/SenteLabsAI/OpenExecutive.git
cd OpenExecutive

# Install the backend and web app dependencies
make install

# Set your Anthropic API key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Start everything
make dev
```

**Trying it on your own computer needs no sign-in setup.** While
`AUTH_GOOGLE_ID` is blank, `make dev` uses local login: the web app
only accepts connections from this computer, you click **Open**, and you are
the owner. To invite your team, or to run it on a server or with `make docker`,
set up Google sign-in by filling in the `AUTH_*` block (see
[docs/auth.md](docs/auth.md) for the Google Cloud Console steps).

All configuration lives in that repo-root `.env` — `make dev` and `make docker`
both load it for the API *and* the UI (Auth.js needs `AUTH_SECRET` /
`AUTH_GOOGLE_ID` / `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET` at runtime). A
`packages/ui/.env.local` is also read for UI-only keys, but for keys present
in both files the root `.env` takes precedence.

Open http://localhost:3000 to start chatting with your executive. The API runs on port 8000 and the UI on 3000.

To check everything is working, open **Settings → Setup status**. It tests
the AI key and each chat app's token, then shows a green, amber or red light
for each part of your setup, with what to do about anything that isn't green.

> **First run:** requires Python 3.11+ and Node 22.6+. The initial `uv sync` pulls heavy
> ML dependencies (ChromaDB + sentence-transformers/PyTorch), and the first boot
> downloads a small embedding model (~90 MB) to build the local vector index — so the
> first `make dev` takes a few minutes before the app is ready. Subsequent starts are fast.

> **On Windows:** run `make` from Git Bash or WSL, not PowerShell or `cmd`.
> The recipes are POSIX shell (`if [ -f .env ]; …`), and GNU Make falls back to
> `cmd.exe` when no `sh` is on PATH — which fails with
> `-f was unexpected at this time`. If Make still picks the wrong shell, point
> it at one: `make dev SHELL="C:/Program Files/Git/bin/sh.exe"`. Note that
> `make stop` uses `lsof` and has no Windows equivalent; stop the two dev
> servers from their own terminals instead.

**For contributors not using `make`:**

```bash
cd packages/core
uv sync
uv run uvicorn openexecutive.api.main:app --reload --port 8000

# In a second terminal
cd packages/ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

`uv run` executes inside the project's virtualenv without activating it, so
these commands are the same on macOS, Linux and Windows. (Activating manually
works too, but the path differs per platform: `.venv/bin/activate` on
macOS/Linux, `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` on Windows.) The `packages/ui`
commands are listed one per line rather than chained with `&&` so that they
run in every shell too: Windows PowerShell 5.1, the version that ships with
Windows, has no `&&` operator and rejects the chained form with `The token
'&&' is not a valid statement separator in this version.`

## Run the Discord Bot

1. Create a Discord application at https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Enable the **Message Content** privileged intent (Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents)
3. Invite the bot with `bot` + `applications.commands` scopes
4. Set env vars in `.env`: `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_APP_ID`, `DISCORD_GUILD_IDS`
5. Run the API normally — the bot starts as part of the FastAPI lifespan when `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is set:

```bash
make dev
```

The bot is embedded in the API process (alongside the email poller, scheduler, and resumer) so it shares the same SQLite database and ChromaDB vector store under `/data` in production. Skip the token to disable.

For iterating on bot-only code without restarting the API, `make discord` runs the bot as a standalone process against the same local DB. Use it **instead of** the embedded bot, not alongside it: stop the API, or start it without `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, first — two processes on one token each open a gateway connection and every message gets answered twice.

Users can DM the bot, `@mention` it in a channel (replies in a thread), or use `/ask` and `/today` slash commands. Slash commands sync to `DISCORD_GUILD_IDS` instantly on startup; leave blank for global registration (up to 1-hour propagation delay).

### Deploying to production

The bot runs inside the existing API process — no extra service. Set these on the API and restart it:

```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=...
DISCORD_APP_ID=...
DISCORD_GUILD_IDS=...
```

Discord user access is managed via the /people UI — add a Person row with `discord_user_id` set.

The bot starts on the next lifespan boot. To disable it, unset `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` and restart.

## Onboarding Your Company

The first time you visit the app, you'll be guided through a wizard to set up your company profile:
- Company basics (name, industry, stage, team size)
- Business model and revenue
- Competitive landscape
- Strategic priorities
- Culture and values
- Optional: financial position, document upload

After onboarding, the Executive will reference your specific company context in every response.

The built-in knowledge base is **trusted by default** — the Executive can use it straight away, and the Review queue starts empty rather than asking you to sign off on ~81 shipped documents. Items reach the queue when you upload a document, edit an existing file, or deliberately send a domain for review from the Review page. While a domain is being reviewed its content is withheld from the Executive, so the UI confirms the count before it starts.

## Interfaces

| Interface | How to Use |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Web UI** | `http://localhost:3000` |
| **Slack** | Mention `@OpenExecutive` or DM the app |
| **Email** | CC or email the configured address (Gmail poller via the Google Workspace MCP) |
| **Telegram** | Message the configured bot |
| **Google Chat** | Mention the app in a space |
| **Discord** | DM the bot, `@mention` it in a channel, or use `/ask` / `/today` slash commands |
| **CLI** | `openexecutive chat` |
| **MCP** | Point any MCP client at `http://localhost:8000/mcp` (see [Connect as an MCP Server](#connect-as-an-mcp-server)) |

## Connect as an MCP Server

Open Executive exposes its company context and specialist council to external
MCP clients (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any other agent), so they
can ground themselves in your company without being re-briefed. There is no
separate server process to start: the server is mounted into the FastAPI app at
`/mcp` over Streamable HTTP, so running the API is running the MCP server.

The endpoint is `http://localhost:8000/mcp`, or `https://<your-host>/mcp` once
deployed. Authentication is the same shared-secret gate as every other route,
so clients send `x-api-key: $BACKEND_SHARED_SECRET`. With that variable unset
locally the gate is off and the header can be omitted.

On any internet-reachable instance set both `BACKEND_SHARED_SECRET` and
`OE_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT=1`, which makes the API refuse to start without a
secret rather than serving `/mcp` unauthenticated. See
[Deployment](#deployment).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "open-executive": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "x-api-key": "YOUR_BACKEND_SHARED_SECRET"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Claude Code can write that entry for you:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http open-executive http://localhost:8000/mcp \
  --header "x-api-key: YOUR_BACKEND_SHARED_SECRET"
```

Connected clients get eight read-only resources (company profile, today's
briefing and activity, people roster, department state, and episodic memory for
decisions, initiatives and advice) and four tools, of which `consult_specialist`
is the primary one: domain analysis from any of the ten specialists, each
grounded in your company's knowledge base. The full inventory is on the **MCP
Server** section of the `/architecture` page. With
[signed callers](docs/auth.md#signed-callers) on, an MCP client holds only the
shared secret, so it is never the owner: `ask_executive` asks as no one.

This is the inverse of the `MCP_ENABLED` and `MCP_SERVERS_CONFIG_PATH` settings
under [Configuration](#configuration), which configure the MCP *gateway*: Open
Executive consuming other servers' tools. The server side needs no configuration
beyond `BACKEND_SHARED_SECRET`. If a client errors on connect, try `/mcp/` with
the trailing slash, since the endpoint 307-redirects and not every client
follows the redirect.

## Document Upload

Upload your pitch deck, financial model, strategy docs, or any company documents via the web UI or API. The Executive will reference them when relevant.

```bash
# Via CLI
openexecutive upload deck.pdf model.xlsx strategy.md

# Via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/documents \
  -F "file=@deck.pdf" \
  -F "domain=strategy"
```

## Deployment

Two containers — the FastAPI backend and the Next.js UI — plus one persistent
volume at `/data`. [docker/docker-compose.yml](docker/docker-compose.yml) is the
reference topology and also what `make docker` runs locally, except that the
compose UI runs as a dev server rather than the production image.

Versioned images are published to GitHub Container Registry on every release,
so a deployment can pull instead of building:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/sentelabsai/openexecutive-api:<version>
docker pull ghcr.io/sentelabsai/openexecutive-ui:<version>
```

Tags: `X.Y.Z` and `X.Y` for a release, `latest` for the most recently
published release, and `main` for the current head of `main`. The available versions are listed on
each package's page under the repository's Packages. See
[docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md#images) for how releases are cut.

**Upgrading.** Settings → About shows the running version and says when a newer
release is out (`UPDATE_CHECK_ENABLED=false` turns the check off). To upgrade,
back up, then rebuild or pull the new tag; see
[docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md#upgrading).

> **⚠️ Single-instance only**: the scheduler claims rows via `UPDATE … RETURNING`,
> which is not safe across processes. A second API replica double-fires every
> scheduled action. Pin the API to one instance. The UI is stateless.

Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `BACKEND_SHARED_SECRET`, `BACKEND_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and
`OE_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT=1` on any internet-reachable instance. See
[docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for the full guide — persistent state,
health-check timing, resource sizing, operations, and common failure modes.

### Access control

The deployed UI is gated behind Google sign-in with an email allow-list, and the public API is protected by a shared-secret header between the UI proxy and the FastAPI backend. See [docs/auth.md](docs/auth.md) for the full setup (Google Cloud Console steps, required environment variables, adding/removing users, rotating secrets, and a debugging table).

## Configuration

## Running on Local Models

Open Executive can run against any **OpenAI-compatible** local server — Ollama,
LM Studio, vLLM, or llama.cpp — instead of (or alongside) the Anthropic API.
Local model slugs route to your server through the same provider abstraction the
hosted models use; no agent or orchestrator code changes.

```bash
# 1. Pull a capable, tool-use-friendly model (example: Ollama)
ollama pull llama3.3

# 2. In .env — point at the local server and list the slugs to expose
LOCAL_MODELS_ENABLED=true
LOCAL_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1   # Ollama default
LOCAL_MODELS=llama3.3

# 3. (Optional) run with NO Anthropic key — make local the default everywhere
DEFAULT_MODEL=llama3.3
DEEP_REASONING_MODEL=llama3.3
ROUTING_MODEL=llama3.3
# ...and leave ANTHROPIC_API_KEY unset
```

The listed slugs appear in the **Council UI** model dropdown, so you can also run
a hybrid setup — keep the Executive on Claude while flipping individual
specialists to a local model per-agent.

**Caveats.** Server-side web search (`ENABLE_WEB_SEARCH`) and Anthropic prompt
caching / extended thinking have no local equivalent and are automatically
disabled for local models. Multi-agent routing leans heavily on tool use, so
pick a model that's strong at it (e.g. Llama 3.3 70B, Qwen2.5) — small models
may route poorly. `LOCAL_API_KEY` is only needed if your server (vLLM, or a
gateway) requires a bearer token; Ollama and LM Studio need none.

### Using a hosted OpenAI-compatible gateway

The `LOCAL_*` settings are not limited to localhost — the same recipe works with
any **hosted** OpenAI-compatible endpoint (an aggregator or inference gateway):

```bash
LOCAL_MODELS_ENABLED=true
LOCAL_BASE_URL=https://gateway.example.com/v1
LOCAL_API_KEY=your-gateway-key
LOCAL_MODELS=vendor/model-a,vendor/model-b
```

The listed slugs are sent to the gateway verbatim and appear in the Council UI
dropdown, exactly like local slugs. Gateways that speak OpenRouter's request
format and model namespace can alternatively be used through the OpenRouter
path (`OPENROUTER_ENABLED=true` + `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` +
`OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=https://gateway.example.com/v1`), which keeps that path's
Claude-name translation and feature handling.

The local-model caveats above apply to the `LOCAL_*` path unchanged, plus one
that matters more for hosted endpoints: everything the Executive processes —
company profile, documents, conversations — is sent to whichever endpoint you
configure here. Point these settings only at a provider you trust with that
data.

## Adding a New Specialist Agent

1. Create `packages/core/openexecutive/agents/your_agent.py` extending `BaseAgent`
2. Add a system prompt constant in `packages/core/openexecutive/prompts/domain_prompts.py`
3. Register in `packages/core/openexecutive/orchestrator/router.py` — add to `SPECIALIST_REGISTRY` and the `specialist` enum in `SPECIALIST_TOOLS`
4. Add domain alias to `DOMAIN_ALIASES` in `packages/core/openexecutive/knowledge/retriever.py`
5. Add knowledge docs to `knowledge/builtin/your_domain/`
6. Add at least 2 eval scenarios to `packages/core/openexecutive/evals/_scenarios/`
7. Submit a PR — CI requires all of the above

## Development

```bash
make dev          # Start FastAPI + Next.js
make test         # Run Python tests
make eval         # Run eval suite
make lint         # Run ruff + mypy
make docker       # Build and run Docker stack

# Unit tests only (no API calls required)
pytest packages/core/tests/unit/ -v
```

## Evaluation System

`evals/` contains 29 scenarios covering all 8 domains, scored by `claude-opus-4-7` as an LLM-as-judge. Each scenario defines a query, simulated company context, expected topics, required specialist routing, and a domain-specific rubric. Five scoring dimensions (persona coherence, domain accuracy, company context utilization, routing quality, actionability) are each rated 1–5. The CI gate requires ≥ 3.5/5 average; any dimension dropping > 10% vs `main` fails the PR.

## Privacy

Everything in `company/` is gitignored — the profile YAML, uploaded documents, and the ChromaDB vector store. None of this leaves your local machine (or your own volume in cloud deployments) except as part of prompts sent to the Anthropic API. Anthropic does not train on API data.
