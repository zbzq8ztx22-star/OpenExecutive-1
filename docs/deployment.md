# Deployment

Open Executive ships as two containers — the FastAPI backend and the Next.js UI —
plus one persistent volume. Anything that can run a Docker image and attach a
disk will host it: `docker compose` on a single box, a container platform, or a
Kubernetes deployment.

[docker/docker-compose.yml](../docker/docker-compose.yml) is the reference
topology. It is also what `make docker` runs locally, with one difference: the
compose UI is a `next dev` server on a bind mount, not the production image
from `Dockerfile.ui`.

---

## ⚠️ Single instance only

**The API must run exactly one replica.** The scheduler claims due rows with
`UPDATE … RETURNING`, which is safe against concurrent claims *within* a process
but not across processes: a second API container fires every scheduled action a
second time — duplicate emails, duplicate Slack messages, duplicate briefings.

There is no leader election. Whatever you deploy on, pin the API to one instance
and use a replace-in-place rollout rather than one that briefly runs two
containers. The UI is stateless and scales freely.

---

## Topology

| Component | Dockerfile | Published image | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| API | [docker/Dockerfile](../docker/Dockerfile) | `ghcr.io/sentelabsai/openexecutive-api` | One persistent volume at `/data` |
| UI | [docker/Dockerfile.ui](../docker/Dockerfile.ui) | `ghcr.io/sentelabsai/openexecutive-ui` | Stateless |

The UI never talks to the API directly from the browser. It proxies through its
own server (`/api/backend/*`), stamping the shared secret on each upstream call,
so the UI origin is the only one that *needs* to be public. See [auth.md](auth.md).

> **The compose file binds the API to `127.0.0.1` on purpose.** The UI reaches it
> over the compose network, so nothing needs it on `0.0.0.0`. If you change that
> binding or put the API behind a proxy on its own hostname, you have made it
> internet-reachable — set `BACKEND_SHARED_SECRET` **and** `OE_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT=1`
> before you do. Neither is set by default, and without them the API serves every
> route unauthenticated with only a log line to say so.

## Images

[.github/workflows/release-images.yml](../.github/workflows/release-images.yml)
builds both images from the Dockerfiles above, with the repo root as build
context, and pushes them to GitHub Container Registry. Nothing is added or
configured in CI. Note that `make docker` builds only the API image — the
compose file runs the UI as a `next dev` server — so this workflow is the only
thing that builds `Dockerfile.ui`.

| Tag | Set by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `X.Y.Z`, `X.Y` | pushing git tag `vX.Y.Z` | A release. Pin deployments to one of these. |
| `latest` | pushing git tag `vX.Y.Z` | The most recently published release, by push order, not the highest version. Pushing a `v0.2.1` patch after `v0.3.0` moves `latest` back to `0.2.1`. |
| `main` | every push to `main` | Current head of `main`; not a release. |
| `sha-<short>` | every push | The commit the image was built from. |
| `buildcache` | every push | BuildKit layer cache. Not an image; ignore it. |

**Cutting a release** is merging the release PR.
[.github/workflows/release-please.yml](../.github/workflows/release-please.yml)
runs release-please on every push to `main` and keeps one open PR,
"chore(main): release X.Y.Z", up to date. PRs are squash-merged, so each one
lands as a single commit whose subject is the PR title, and the version comes
from those titles' conventional-commit types since the last release. Before 1.0,
`feat` and `fix` both bump the patch version and a breaking change (`!` or a
`BREAKING CHANGE:` footer) bumps the minor; minor versions are kept for
milestones. From 1.0 the usual rule applies: `feat` → minor, `fix` → patch,
breaking → major. The PR bumps
every place the version is written (listed in `release-please-config.json`)
and adds the `CHANGELOG.md` entry, which can be edited in the PR before
merging. Merges that are only `chore`/`docs`/`test`/`refactor` wait for the
next `feat` or `fix`. Merging the release PR tags the merge commit `vX.Y.Z`
and creates the GitHub Release; the tag push then runs the image workflow.
It needs the `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` repository secret (a fine-grained token
for this repository with Contents and Pull requests read/write), because
events made with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` start no workflows: without it
the release PR would get no CI and the tag would publish no images.

Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag by hand still works (`git tag v0.3.0 && git push
origin v0.3.0`) but bypasses the version bump and changelog, so the release
PR is the normal path.

The image workflow runs on the tag push and publishes the versioned tags. It
does not check CI: it publishes whatever commit the tag points at, and the
`main` tag is published in parallel with CI on every push, so the release PR
should only be merged once its CI is green. The two images are separate jobs,
so a release is not atomic — if one fails, check the package pages and re-run
the failed job from the Actions UI.

Once both images are published, the same run creates the GitHub Release for
the tag if it does not exist yet (release-please normally already made it),
with that version's `CHANGELOG.md` section as the notes. A hand-pushed tag
with no `## [X.Y.Z]` section fails that job instead of publishing an empty
release. If the images fail, no release is
created; re-running the failed job from the Actions UI creates it once the
images succeed. A release that already exists for the tag is left alone.

The images are `linux/amd64` only. The API image bakes the embedding models at
build time (see the Dockerfile), which makes an emulated arm64 build
impractically slow.

> **First publish:** GitHub creates each package as private. An org admin makes
> `openexecutive-api` and `openexecutive-ui` public once under the org's
> Packages settings; until then `docker pull` needs a token with `read:packages`.

---

## Persistent state

One volume, mounted at `/data`:

- `/data/chroma_db/` — ChromaDB vector index (built-in knowledge + uploaded company docs)
- `/data/episodic_memory.db` — SQLite: episodic memory, people, alerts, scheduled actions, audit log
- `/data/company/profile.yaml` + `/data/company/docs/` — onboarding output + uploaded docs
- `/data/company/mcp_servers.json` — MCP gateway config. Placing this file is what **enables** MCP when `MCP_ENABLED` is unset; set `MCP_ENABLED=false` to keep MCP off with the file in place. A config defining no servers under `mcpServers`, or a gateway that fails to start, is logged and skipped — the API boots without MCP tools (and without the email poller) rather than failing to boot.
- `/data/google_credentials/` — Google Workspace OAuth token, if that integration is enabled
- `/data/ms365_credentials/` — Microsoft 365 MSAL token cache (+ its `.cache-key`), if that integration is enabled

Nothing hardcodes those paths. Each is an env var, and the defaults are
repo-relative so a local checkout works with no configuration:

```
VECTOR_STORE_PATH             = /data/chroma_db
EPISODIC_DB_PATH              = /data/episodic_memory.db
COMPANY_PROFILE_PATH          = /data/company/profile.yaml
MCP_SERVERS_CONFIG_PATH       = /data/company/mcp_servers.json
WORKSPACE_MCP_CREDENTIALS_DIR = /data/google_credentials
MS365_MCP_CREDENTIALS_DIR     = /data/ms365_credentials
```

On first boot the volume is empty. ChromaDB rebuilds the built-in knowledge index
from files shipped inside the Python package (`openexecutive/knowledge/builtin/`),
and the SQLite database is created on demand. The company profile stays empty
until you run the onboarding wizard against the deployed URL — the wizard failing
with "no company profile" on a fresh volume is expected, not a fault.

---

## Required configuration

| Variable | Why |
|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Every agent call. The app will not start without it. |
| `BACKEND_SHARED_SECRET` | Gates every API route via `x-api-key`. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`; the UI needs the same value. |
| `CALLER_ASSERTION_PUBLIC_KEYS` (API), `CALLER_ASSERTION_PRIVATE_KEY` (UI) | Signed callers: the UI signs who is signed in and the API checks it, so the shared secret alone can't act as the owner. Recommended. Make the pair with `scripts/make-caller-keys.py`; see [auth.md](auth.md#signed-callers). |
| `OE_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT=1` | **Set this on every internet-reachable instance.** See below. |
| `BACKEND_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated UI origins allowed through CORS, e.g. `https://exec.example.com`. |
| `AUTH_SECRET`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`, `AUTH_URL`, `ALLOWED_EMAILS` | UI sign-in. See [auth.md](auth.md). |

Integrations (Slack, Discord, email, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365) are all
optional and off unless their variables are set. [.env.example](../.env.example) is the full list.

### `OE_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT`

If `BACKEND_SHARED_SECRET` is unset the API serves every route unauthenticated.
That is the intended default for local development and a serious incident
anywhere else, so a deployment declares itself public:

```
OE_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT=1
```

With it set and no shared secret, `create_app()` raises at startup instead of
booting an open API. The check is deliberately fail-safe — any value other than
`0`/`false`/`no`/`off`/empty arms it, so a typo requires the secret rather than
skipping the check.

---

## Health checks

`GET /health` is exempt from the shared-secret gate so a platform health checker
can reach it unauthenticated. It returns:

```json
{"status": "ok", "builtin_knowledge_chunks": 1234, "version": "0.1.0"}
```

**Give it a startup grace period of about 5 minutes.** A cold container builds
the MCP tool-discovery vector index and loads Chroma before it serves. The
embedding model is baked into the image, so no network fetch is involved, but
the work is real — a short grace period will kill the container mid-boot in a
crash loop that looks like a deploy failure.

## Resources

**2 GB of memory for the API.** 1 GB out-of-memories during ingest, where the
ONNX embedder and Chroma writes run concurrently. One shared CPU is sufficient;
the workload is I/O-bound on the Anthropic API.

---

## Google Workspace credentials

The Gmail/Calendar/Drive tools come from `workspace-mcp`, which runs co-located
inside the API as a stdio child of the MCP gateway rather than as its own
service — the product is single-tenant, so the server is inherently one per
install. It is baked into the API image and launched by
[docker/workspace-mcp-launch.sh](../docker/workspace-mcp-launch.sh) from the
`google_workspace` entry in `/data/company/mcp_servers.json` (see
[packages/core/mcp_servers.json.example](../packages/core/mcp_servers.json.example)
for the exact block).

`GWORKSPACE_AUTH_MODE` picks the auth mode; it defaults to `oauth`.

**Option A — `oauth` (single user).** Set `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and
`GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`. The API serves no OAuth callback, so the token has
to be seeded: complete the flow once locally with `WORKSPACE_MCP_CREDENTIALS_DIR`
pointed at a local folder, then copy the credential file onto the volume.

```bash
docker compose exec api mkdir -p /data/google_credentials
docker compose cp <local-credentials-dir>/<token-file> api:/data/google_credentials/
docker compose restart api        # the gateway reads config and credentials at startup
```

**Option B — `service_account` (domain-wide delegation).** No browser flow, but a
Workspace admin must authorize the service account's client ID for the
Gmail/Calendar/Drive scopes:

```
GWORKSPACE_AUTH_MODE=service_account
USER_GOOGLE_EMAIL=exec@yourcompany.com
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_JSON=<contents of service-account.json>
```

(`GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE`, a path to a key already on the volume, works
too. The launcher fails fast if neither the key nor `USER_GOOGLE_EMAIL` is set.)

Outbound egress is gated either way: the Executive can only email, invite, or
share with People on the roster.

Every Google Workspace call acts as the Executive's own account: the gateway
refuses a call whose `user_google_email` names any other address.

### Your own Gmail (Act as me, optional)

Act as me lets the Executive draft replies **as the owner**, in the owner's
own Gmail Drafts, when they ask it to, and (with **Draft replies to my
inbox** on) for mail that needs them. Nothing goes out unless the owner sends
it: from Gmail, or with **Send** on a reply card on Today, which needs signed
sign-ins on a server (see `docs/auth.md`). It uses a separate
credential for the owner's mailbox, read by the API directly and never handed
to workspace-mcp, so it must not live in the credentials directory above.

```bash
# On a machine with a browser, with the same OAuth client exported:
uv run --with google-auth-oauthlib python scripts/connect-own-gmail.py --email you@example.com
docker compose exec api mkdir -p /data/delegation_google
docker compose cp delegation-credentials/<file>.json api:/data/delegation_google/
```

No restart is needed. The address must be the owner's email on the People
page, and it must not be the Executive's own `EXEC_EMAIL_ADDRESS`. Then turn
it on in Settings → Act as me; the setup status page shows the connection.

**Team members (optional).** Set `DELEGATION_TEAM_MEMBERS=true` and the owner
gets **Let team members use it** in Settings → Act as me. Once they turn it
on, each team member connects their own Gmail the same way (the script with
their own address, one file each in the same directory) and turns it on for
themselves. A team member's mail, drafts, reply cards and audit rows are
theirs alone: the owner sees only who uses it and how much.

---

## Upgrading

**Settings → About** shows the version you are running. When a newer release
is out it says so and links the release notes and this section. The API asks
GitHub's public releases API for the latest release at most every six hours,
and sends nothing about your install. Set `UPDATE_CHECK_ENABLED=false` to turn
the check off (for an air-gapped host, say); the running version is still shown.
`GET /version` returns the same facts as JSON.

There is no in-app update button: updating means replacing the containers,
which the app cannot do from inside one without being given control of the
host's Docker. Upgrade from the host instead.

1. **Read the release notes.** Each release's entry in
   [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) (also on the GitHub Release) lists what
   changed. Before 1.0 a minor bump (`0.4.x` → `0.5.0`) marks a breaking
   change, such as a new required env var; do what its entry says first.
2. **Back up the database.** `/data/episodic_memory.db` is the part you cannot
   rebuild; see Backups under [Operations](#operations).
3. **Replace the containers.** Your data lives in the `executive_data` volume,
   which survives both of these.

   From a checkout, with `make docker`:

   ```bash
   git fetch --tags
   git checkout vX.Y.Z     # or `git pull` on main to follow unreleased changes
   make docker             # rebuilds the API image and restarts the stack
   ```

   From the published images: change the image tags to the new release
   (`ghcr.io/sentelabsai/openexecutive-api:X.Y.Z` and
   `ghcr.io/sentelabsai/openexecutive-ui:X.Y.Z`), then

   ```bash
   docker compose pull
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   Never run `docker compose down -v` to upgrade: `-v` deletes the volume.
4. **Check it came back.** `curl -s http://localhost:8000/health` reports the
   new `version`, and Settings → About shows it.

To go back, see **Rollback** under [Operations](#operations).

## Microsoft 365 credentials

Outlook mail and calendar tools come from `@softeria/ms-365-mcp-server`, a
Node MCP server that — like `workspace-mcp` — runs co-located inside the API as
a stdio child of the MCP gateway. It is baked into the API image (a Node build
stage copies the pinned package and the `node` binary in; there is no npm in
the runtime image) and launched by
[docker/ms365-mcp-launch.sh](../docker/ms365-mcp-launch.sh) from the
`microsoft_365` entry in `/data/company/mcp_servers.json` (see
[packages/core/mcp_servers.json.example](../packages/core/mcp_servers.json.example)
for the exact block). Both servers can be configured at once; the Executive
discovers whichever tools are present.

Auth is the MSAL **device-code** flow against your own Entra app registration
(the server's built-in public client id is refused). Register the app (Entra
admin center → App registrations → New; *Allow public client flows: Yes*;
delegated Graph permissions `Mail.ReadWrite`, `Mail.Send`, `Calendars.ReadWrite`,
plus `User.Read` and `offline_access` for the sign-in, with admin consent —
`ms365-mcp-launch.sh --list-permissions` prints exactly what the configured
tool list requests), then set:

```
MS365_MCP_CLIENT_ID=<application (client) id>
MS365_MCP_TENANT_ID=<directory (tenant) id>          # or "common" / "consumers"
MS365_MCP_EXPECTED_USERNAME=exec@yourcompany.com     # pins the signed-in account
MS365_MCP_CLIENT_SECRET=<only for a confidential app registration>
```

The API serves no OAuth callback and needs none: sign in once from inside the
container and the refresh token lands on the volume.

```bash
docker compose exec api /usr/local/bin/ms365-mcp-launch.sh --login          # prints a URL + code; sign in as the exec mailbox
docker compose exec api /usr/local/bin/ms365-mcp-launch.sh --verify-login
docker compose restart api        # the gateway reads config and credentials at startup
```

Setup is the launcher's `--login`, never chat: `MS365_MCP_EXPECTED_USERNAME`
is what stops a different account being bound. Run `--login` again if the
refresh token is ever revoked — until then every Microsoft 365 call answers
with an error payload and the API keeps serving. The server registers its
account tools whatever `--enabled-tools` says, so the gateway refuses
`microsoft_365__login`, `logout`, `select-account` and `remove-account`
itself and leaves them out of `search_tools` results — a chat turn cannot
sign the mailbox out, wipe the seeded token or switch accounts, whatever
`mcp_servers.json` says. The example config denies them too (defense in
depth). The read-only `verify-login` and `list-accounts` stay callable.

The launcher scrubs `$VAR` placeholders that extensible-mcp leaves literal for
unset variables, refuses to start without `MS365_MCP_CLIENT_ID`, keeps the
token cache under `MS365_MCP_CREDENTIALS_DIR` (0700), and starts the server
with an **explicit allow-list** of tools (`--enabled-tools`, an anchored regex
in the launcher) rather than the upstream `mail,calendar` preset: the preset
also registers inbox forwarding rules, mailbox settings (external auto-reply),
calendar sharing and event forwarding, which can address people the gateway
never sees. Exactly the Outlook mail + calendar tools (plus the login tools)
are exposed. Egress is gated like Google: `send-mail`, forward and every draft
tool have their recipients roster-checked from the arguments; reply,
reply-all and send-draft — whose recipient is whoever the referenced message
names — have the gateway read that message first and check the sender /
original recipients / draft recipients (reply-all checks `replyTo` and the
sender together); `create-/update-calendar-event` attendees must be People
on the roster. Every mail write's `from`, `sender` and `replyTo` may name
only `EXEC_EMAIL_ADDRESS` (the Outlook twin of the Gmail acting-account pin),
and `move-mail-message` into Deleted Items, Junk Email or Recoverable Items
is refused, so the model cannot trash mail through a move. Widening the allow-list
(`MS365_MCP_ENABLED_TOOLS` / `MS365_MCP_PRESET`) is an operator decision that
must come with a matching gate change in `orchestrator/mcp_gateway.py`.

### Switching the mailbox and calendar to Microsoft 365

Adding the server only gives the Executive Outlook *tools*. Three code paths
call a fixed backend without the model choosing — the inbound mailbox poller,
alert email dispatch and the scheduler's email hint, and the typed
`create_calendar_event` / `create_instant_meeting` tools with their approval
ledger. They follow two switches, both defaulting to `google`:

```
EMAIL_PROVIDER=microsoft      # poll the Outlook inbox; reply via microsoft_365__reply-mail-message
CALENDAR_PROVIDER=microsoft   # book on the Outlook calendar with a Teams link
```

The switches are independent. A chosen backend whose MCP server is missing
from `mcp_servers.json` is logged at startup and the poller skips its cycle;
boot never fails. On Microsoft the approval-time conflict check reads only the
Executive's own calendar (delegated permissions cannot read attendees'
free/busy), so it is advisory in a narrower sense than Google's.

---

## Operations

```bash
# Logs
docker compose logs -f api

# Smoke the API directly
curl -s -H "x-api-key: $BACKEND_SHARED_SECRET" https://api.example.com/health

# Same JSON, proxied through the UI (exercises the shared secret end to end)
curl -s https://exec.example.com/api/backend/health

# Inspect state on the volume — SELECT only unless you mean it
docker compose exec api sqlite3 /data/episodic_memory.db \
  "SELECT id, kind, status, run_at FROM scheduled_actions WHERE status='pending' LIMIT 10;"
```

**Rollback** is an image-tag rollback: redeploy the previous release tag
(see [Images](#images)). The volume is
not versioned with the image, so a release that migrates schema forward is not
undone by rolling the image back — check what changed under `*/store.py` before
relying on it. Additive column migrations (the common case — every column has a
default and older builds name their columns explicitly) are safe to roll back
over; a rolled-back build simply ignores the newer columns.

**Backups.** There is no snapshot cron in this repo. `/data/episodic_memory.db`
is the irreplaceable part (Chroma rebuilds from source documents), so back it up
with `sqlite3 /data/episodic_memory.db ".backup /tmp/backup.db"` and copy it off
the host — a plain file copy of a live SQLite database can be torn.

---

## Common failure modes

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Deploy reports success, `/health` never responds | Crash during boot, usually a missing env var | Read the API logs; look for a Pydantic `ValidationError` naming the variable |
| Container is killed and restarted repeatedly during startup | Health-check grace period too short | Raise it to ~5 minutes (see above) |
| API refuses to start: `BACKEND_SHARED_SECRET is required` | `OE_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT` is set with no secret | Working as intended — set the secret |
| Every UI request errors, API is healthy | UI proxy can't reach the API, or the shared secret differs between them | Check `BACKEND_BASE_URL` on the UI and that both sides carry the same `BACKEND_SHARED_SECRET` |
| Every UI request is `401` with a `caller_assertion_*` code | Signed callers are half set up | See [auth.md → Debugging](auth.md#debugging) |
| Browser console shows CORS errors | UI origin missing from `BACKEND_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Add the exact scheme + host |
| Scheduled actions firing twice | More than one API replica | Scale the API to exactly 1 (see the warning at the top) |
| Onboarding wizard says "no company profile" | Empty volume on first boot | Expected — complete the wizard; output lands at `/data/company/profile.yaml` |

## Optional: self-hosted Honcho

Per-person memory can run against hosted Honcho (set `HONCHO_API_KEY` and
`HONCHO_BASE_URL`) or a self-hosted instance. [docker/honcho/](../docker/honcho/)
carries the image and configuration for the self-hosted path.
